# rip-aoa
Pale Moon fork of the old Remove It Permanently XUL Firefox extension

## What it's for

RIP All Over Again allows you to use the browser context menu in Pale Moon 
to permanently remove individual elements from a webpage or even a whole site.

It doesn't always work on elements generated by Javascript or elements with
ambiguous or changeable XPaths.

## Status of this Add-On

Effectively, it's in maintenance mode.  Since I use it myself, I'll attempt to keep
it functioning at the same level as it did when it became unsupported on Firefox, but 
I'm unlikely to add new features, or even worry too much about bugs that existed
under previous management (I'll fix them if they seem to be easy fixes).  

I'm happy to accept merge requests, though.

## History of this Add-On

RIP All Over Again was forked from RIP Advanced in May 2021.

RIP Advanced was the creation of Jerome O'Flaherty.
