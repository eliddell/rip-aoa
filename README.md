# rip-aoa
Pale Moon fork of the old Remove It Permanently XUL Firefox extension

## What it's for

RIP-AOA allows you to use the browser context menu in Pale Moon to permanently 
remove individual elements from a webpage or even a whole site.

It doesn't always work on elements generated by Javascript or elements with
ambiguous or changeable XPaths.

## Status of this Add-On

Effectively, it's in maintenance mode.  Since I use it myself, I'll attempt to keep
it functioning at the same level as it did when it became unsupported on Firefox, but 
I'm unlikely to add new features, or even worry too much about bugs that existed
under previous management (I'll fix them if they seem to be easy fixes).  

I'm happy to accept merge requests, though.

## Why isn't this in the Pale Moon Add-Ons Repository?

I'm unwilling to guarantee I can maintain this extension over the long term (it's near 
the bottom of a stack of a dozen or more things in terms of priority, and my health is 
not great).  The people running the official add-ons repository were understandably 
uncomfortable with the idea of hosting an add-on that might abruptly end up broken or
unmaintained.  I figured that an external repository was the best solution for everyone.

## History of this Add-On

RIP All Over Again was forked from RIP Advanced in May 2021.

RIP Advanced was the creation of Jerome O'Flaherty.
